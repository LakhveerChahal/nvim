# Prerequisites:


1. For java 17, the compatible version for jdtls is 1.36.0. We need to configure the mason registry manually since the timestamp in the url is hardcoded.

Find the timestamps here: https://download.eclipse.org/jdtls/milestones/1.36.0/

2. For telescope, install ripgrep using `sudo apt install ripgrep`. This enables faster global searches throughout the project.
